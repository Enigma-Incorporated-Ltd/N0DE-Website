# Frontend development aggregation

This folder aggregates every commit authored by the `Builder.io` bot across all branches currently available in the repository. The list is regenerated by running `python scripts/collect_builderio_commits.py`, which captures each commit hash, date, subject, and the files touched.

Conflict resolution guidance: if future branches contain overlapping Builder.io changes, prefer the most recent commit in the generated list and replay those edits under the `Frontend_development` branch. The `builderio_commits.json` file is ordered by commit recency, so newer entries appear first.
