# Frontend development aggregation
This folder aggregates every commit authored by the `Builder.io` bot across all branches currently available in the repository.
The list is regenerated by running `python scripts/collect_builderio_commits.py`, which captures each commit hash, date, subject,
and the files touched.

Conflict resolution guidance: if future branches contain overlapping Builder.io changes, prefer the most recent commit in the
generated list and replay those edits under the `Frontend_development` branch. The `builderio_commits.json` file is ordered by commit recency, so newer entries appear first.

To reapply those changes onto a working branch, run `python scripts/apply_builderio_commits.py`. The script cherry-picks each
Builder.io commit that is not already in your history (newest to oldest) and uses the `-X ours` strategy so that newer changes
win automatically when conflicts arise.

Note: The `public/favicon.ico` file has been restored to its original version to avoid binary diffs that prevent PR generation.
