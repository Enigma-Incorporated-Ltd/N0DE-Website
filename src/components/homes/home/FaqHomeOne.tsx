												You will notice a clear increase in stability, with fewer latency spikes and less jitter.
												N0DE reduces latency fluctuation and smooths throughput so real-time apps feel snappier.
												<br /><br />
												There can be a small decrease in headline bandwidth, typically around 15 percent, due to
												the extra TCP acceleration and control overheads. Most connections do not use their full
												rated speed during normal activity, so real-world performance still improves. N0DE fixes
												fundamental inefficiencies in common internet transport paths, which means you get more
												usable performance per Mbps even if a speed test shows a slightly lower peak.

													Yes. N0DE Pro and N0DE MAX improve traffic for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Mobile — all at the same time — because the optimization runs on our N0DE-configured CPE and affects all network traffic that passes through it. For best results we recommend devices connect via an ethernet port, but the system delivers Wi‑Fi 6 capability.
												</p>
												<p>
													For our software-only deployment, our current version is Windows but more are coming online soon, including Mobile.

			You don't! That is why we have N0DE Lite, a software-only version deployable onto your own individual device (currently only Windows PC available).
		</p>
		<p>
			However, for users seeking full-network optimization or running bandwidth-intensive setups, a standalone N0DE device is essential. To meet this demand, we've engineered a select range of off-the-shelf routers with custom-installed and pre-configured N0DE software — transforming them into powerful edge devices that offload processing and deliver end-to-end optimization across the entire network.
		</p>
		<p>
			These enhanced units do the heavy lifting, ensuring AI-driven traffic prioritization, lag-free gaming, and seamless multi-platform streaming — not just for one device, but for every connection in your environment.

												N0DE uses patented QoS techniques with machine learning to classify traffic types and
